# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am Maria, a .NET developer based in Trondheim, Norway. I started my programming journey back in 2015, as a SharePoint developer (ouch!) and later switched to .NET. 
- Law school graduate, postgraduate in software engineering, hope to get my CS degree one day
- Azure certified (AZ-900, AZ-204, working on getting AZ-400)
- I speak Polish, Norwegian, English and French.

I started this page to track things I learned - be it programming or language learning.
