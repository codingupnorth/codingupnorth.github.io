Hi!

I am Maria, a .NET developer based in Trondheim, Norway. I started my programming journey back in 2015, as a SharePoint developer (ouch!) and later switched to .NET. 
- Law school graduate, postgraduate in software engineering, hope to get my CS degree one day
- Azure certified (AZ-900, AZ-204, working on getting AZ-400)
- I speak Polish, Norwegian, English and French.

I started this page to track things I learned - be it programming or language learning.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/mariazieba) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codingupnorth).
